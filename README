It just kernel that has been made by following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-your-own-operating-system-from-scratch/. But I used gnu assembler and grub as a loader instead nasm and self-written loader.

Currently the build rpocess is a litle bit messy and of course it is not intended for ordinary users.
Branches:
	original: kernel just after the course.
	main: all of the following changes occur here.
Building:

1.Building userland programs:
	cd ./user_programs/user2(shell)/
	./build.sh
	cp ./user2 ../../iso/boot

	cd ./user_programs/totalmem/
	./build.sh

	cd ./user_programs/ls/
	./build.sh

	mount disk.img and copy totalmem and ls files to image.

	copy disk.img to /iso/boot

2.Building the kernel:

	make all
	or make qemu to run
