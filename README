Diy kernel. I used gnu assembler and grub as a loader.

What's implemented:
-multiboot2
-64-bit
-IDT and GDT
-paging
-Userspace
-disk(ATA PIO) driver
-fat16 filesystem


May it be Something new and something simple to read and understand. I build it according to my knowledge to study computer devices and in my free time, which is not much, so everything can be built from dirt and sticks, if you know how do it better you can always help :)

For each solved issue I can pay 5$ in monero unless more are specified. If I do not have such an opportunity, I will remove this inscription.

Building:

	make all
	or make qemu to run
