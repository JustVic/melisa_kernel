It just kernel that has been made by following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-your-own-operating-system-from-scratch/. But I used gnu assembler and grub as a loader instead nasm and self-written loader.

Currently the build rpocess is a litle bit messy and of course it is not intended for ordinary users.

What's implemented:
-64-bit
-IDT and GDT
-paging
-Userspace
-disk(ATA PIO) driver
-fat16 filesystem

May it be Something new and something simple.

Branches:
	original: kernel just after the course.
	main: all of the following changes occur here.
Building:

	make all
	or make qemu to run
